To set the machine up download "setup" to your OpenWRT machine and run it.
The only tested version of OpenWRT is 19.07.2-x86-64-combined-ext4.
Make sure internet connection is available while setup is running, so it can download the required packages.
After setup is done running, restart the machine and the service will start at boot.
